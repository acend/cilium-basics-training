## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Allowing Specific Communication Between Clusters


The following policy illustrates how to allow particular pods to communicate between two clusters.

{{< highlight yaml >}}{{< readfile file="content/en/docs/09/02/cnp-cm.yaml" >}}{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
For the Pods to resolve the `rebel-base` service name they still need connectivity to Kubernetes DNS Service. Therefore access to that is also allowed.
{{% /alert %}}

Kubernetes security policies are not automatically distributed across clusters, it is your responsibility to apply `CiliumNetworkPolicy` or `NetworkPolicy` in all clusters.

So let us apply the above `CiliumNetworkPolicy` to both clusters:

```bash
kubectl --context cluster1 apply -f cnp-cm.yaml
kubectl --context cluster2 apply -f cnp-cm.yaml
```

Let us run our `curl` `for` loop again

```bash
XWINGPOD=$(kubectl --context cluster1 get pod -l name=x-wing -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
for i in {1..10}; do                                       
  kubectl --context cluster1 exec -it $XWINGPOD -- curl -m 1 rebel-base
done
```

and as an result you see:

```c
url: (28) Connection timed out after 1001 milliseconds
command terminated with exit code 28
curl: (28) Connection timed out after 1000 milliseconds
command terminated with exit code 28
{"Galaxy": "Alderaan", "Cluster": "Cluster-1"}
curl: (28) Connection timed out after 1000 milliseconds
command terminated with exit code 28
{"Galaxy": "Alderaan", "Cluster": "Cluster-1"}
{"Galaxy": "Alderaan", "Cluster": "Cluster-1"}
{"Galaxy": "Alderaan", "Cluster": "Cluster-1"}
curl: (28) Connection timed out after 1000 milliseconds
command terminated with exit code 28
{"Galaxy": "Alderaan", "Cluster": "Cluster-1"}
curl: (28) Connection timed out after 1000 milliseconds
command terminated with exit code 28
```

All connections to `cluster2` are dropped while the ones to `cluster1` are still working.
