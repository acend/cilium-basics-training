## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Create and use a DNS-aware Network Policy

In this task, we want to keep our backend pods from reaching anything except FQDN kubernetes.io.

First we store the `backend` Pod name into an environment variable:

```bash
BACKEND=$(kubectl get pods -l app=backend -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
echo ${BACKEND}
```

and then let us check if we can reach `https://kubernetes.io` and `https://cilium.io`:

```bash
kubectl exec -ti ${BACKEND} -- curl -Ik --connect-timeout 5 https://kubernetes.io | head -1
```

```bash
kubectl exec -ti ${BACKEND} -- curl -Ik --connect-timeout 5 https://cilium.io | head -1
```

```
# Call to https://kubernetes.io 
HTTP/2 200 
# Call to https://cilium.io
HTTP/2 200 
```

Again, in Kubernetes, all traffic is allowed by default, and since we did not apply any Egress network policy for now, connections from the backend pods are not blocked.

Let us have a look at the following `CiliumNetworkPolicy`:

{{< highlight yaml >}}{{< readfile file="content/en/docs/07/01/backend-egress-allow-fqdn.yaml" >}}{{< /highlight >}}

The policy will deny all egress traffic from pods labeled `app=backend` except when traffic is destined for `kubernetes.io` or is a DNS request (necessary for resolving `kubernetes.io` from coredns). In the policy editor this looks like this:

![Cilium Editor - DNS-aware Network Policy](cilium_dns_policy.png)

Create the file `backend-egress-allow-fqdn.yaml` with the above content and apply the network policy:

```bash
kubectl apply -f backend-egress-allow-fqdn.yaml
```

and check if the `CiliumNetworkPolicy` was created:

```bash
kubectl get cnp                                
```

```
NAME                        AGE
backend-egress-allow-fqdn   2s
```

Note the usage of `cnp` (standing for `CiliumNetworkPolicy`) instead of the default netpol since we are using custom Cilium resources.

And check that the traffic is now only authorized when destined for `kubernetes.io`:

```bash
kubectl exec -ti ${BACKEND} -- curl -Ik --connect-timeout 5 https://kubernetes.io | head -1
```

```bash
kubectl exec -ti ${BACKEND} -- curl -Ik --connect-timeout 5 https://cilium.io | head -1
```

```
# Call to https://kubernetes.io 
HTTP/2 200 
# Call to https://cilium.io
curl: (28) Connection timed out after 5001 milliseconds
command terminated with exit code 28

```

You can now check the `Hubble Metrics` dashboard in Grafana again. The graphs under DNS should soon show some data as well. This is because with a Layer 7 Policy we have enabled the Envoy in Cilium Agent.
{{% /alert %}}

With the ingress and egress policies in place on `app=backend` pods, we have implemented a simple zero-trust model to all traffic to and from our backend. In a real-world scenario, cluster administrators may leverage network policies and overlay them at all levels and for all kinds of traffic.


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2: Cleanup

To not mess up the proceeding labs we are going to delete the `CiliumNetworkPolicy` again and therefore allow all egress traffic again:

```bash
kubectl delete cnp backend-egress-allow-fqdn
```
