Not only does Hubble allow us to inspect flows from the command line, but it also allows us to see them in real-time on a graphical service map via Hubble UI. Again, this also is an optional component that is disabled by default.


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Enable the Hubble UI component

Enabling the optional Hubble UI component with Helm looks like this:

```bash
helm upgrade -i cilium cilium/cilium --version 1.11.1 \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --reuse-values \
  --set hubble.ui.enabled=true \
  --wait
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
When using the `cilium` CLI you can execute the following command to enable the Hubble UI:

```bash
cilium hubble enable --ui
```
{{% /alert %}}

Take a look at the pods again to see what happened under the hood:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
```

We see, there is again a new Pod running for the `hubble-ui` component.

Cilium agents are restarting, and a new Hubble UI Pod is now present on top of the Hubble Relay pod. As above, we can wait for Cilium and Hubble to be ready by running:

```bash
cilium status --wait
```

```
cilium status --wait

```


And then check Hubble status:

```bash
hubble status
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Our earlier command Cilium Hubble port-forward should still be running (can be checked by running jobs or `ps aux | grep "cilium hubble port-forward"`). If it does not, Hubble status will fail and we have to run it again:

```bash
cilium hubble port-forward&
hubble status
```

{{% /alert %}}


To start Hubble UI execute

```bash
cilium hubble ui &
```

In our Webshell environment you can use the public IP of the VM to access Hubble. A simple way it to execute `echo "http://$(curl -s ifconfig.me):12000"` and copy the output in a new browser tab. If you are working locally the browser should open http://localhost:12000/ (open it manually if not).

We can then access the graphical service map by selecting our default Namespace:

![Hubble UI Choose Namespace](../cilium_choose_ns.png)

Then you should see a spinning circle and the message "Waiting for service map data..."

Let's generate some network activity again:

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
  kubectl exec -ti ${FRONTEND} -- curl -I --connect-timeout 5 backend:8080
  kubectl exec -ti ${NOT_FRONTEND} -- curl -I --connect-timeout 5 backend:8080
done
```

and then you should see a service map in the Hubble UI

![Hubble UI - Service Map](../hubble_ui_servicemap.png)

and also a table with the already familiar flow output previously seen in the `hubble observe` command:

![Hubble UI - Service Map](../hubble_ui_flows.png)

Hubble flows are displayed in real-time at the bottom, with a visualization of the namespace objects in the center. Click on any flow, and click on any property from the right-side panel: notice that the filters at the top of the UI have been updated accordingly.

Let's run a connectivity test again and see what happens in Hubble UI in the `cilium-test` Namespace. Since this test runs for a few minutes this could be a good time to grab a :coffee:.

```bash
cilium connectivity test
```

We can see that Hubble UI is not only capable of displaying flows within a Namespace, it also helps visualize flows going in or out of it.

![Hubble UI - Connectivity Test](../cilium_hubble_connectivity_test.png)

And there are also several visual options in the Hubble UI:
